## Description
So recently I've been playing Genshin Impact, a new game from Mihoyo and i have a lot of fun with it. Cause i'm trying to renew my certification for Basic Android Programming, why dont i make some app that contain genshin impact in it? This app is simple, and i'm trying to keep it that way. This app will be able to show local data into Recycler View, and when we click on one of the item we will be able to see more detail of the content.

## Features
Feature that i add to this program is based on Dicoding Criteria:
- [x] Create a Main Activity to display Item with a minimum of 10 Different item.
- [x] When one of the item is click, the app will display a Detail Activity to show more detail of the Item
- [x] Show image and related Information for the Item in Detail Activity
- [x] About Activity that contain personal Information about myself such as profile pic, name, and email
- [x] Added Splash Screen
- [x] Favorite Button
