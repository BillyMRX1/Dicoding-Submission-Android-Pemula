## Description
So recently I've been playing Genshin Impact, a new game from Mihoyo and i have a lot of fun with it. Cause i'm trying to renew my certification for Basic Android Programming, why dont i make some app that contain genshin impact in it? This app is simple, and i'm trying to keep it that way. This app will be able to show local data into Recycler View, and when we click on one of the item we will be able to see more detail of the content.
